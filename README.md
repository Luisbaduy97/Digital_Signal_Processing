# Digital_Signal_Processing

This repository includes a set of practices related to the filtering of biological signals.

In the first practice folder, the filtering of an ECG signal is included, for filtering, low-pass and high-pass FIR filters were used to achieve filtering.

The second practice folder includes filtering an EMG-type signal, IIR low-pass and high-pass filters were used for filtering to achieve filtering.

I also include within the two projects the analyzes in time and frequency by both the Fourier transform for the ECG signal and the Wavelet transform for the EMG signal.
